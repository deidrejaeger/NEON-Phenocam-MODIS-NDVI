### Calculating NDVI from daily MODIS reflectance and Phenocam imagery
All the images analysed are contained at the folders: IR and NoIR

IR -> IR images
No IR -> RGB images

Every time the loop runs, the analysis is done over a pair of images: IR + RGB
In our test, we've downloaded 360 images (a week of observations).

### Use Case at Sample folder
The first use case is shown at Sample Folder. Different images (RAW -> IR + RGB and NDVI) are attached in order to understand the different steps of the NDVI Analysis.
